
## Problem Statement

# Write a program which asks the user what their favorite animal is, and then always responds with "My favorite animal is also ___!" (the blank should be filled in with the user-inputted animal, of course).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics - note the space between the prompt and the user input!):

# What's your favorite animal? cow 

# My favorite animal is also cow!

## Starter Code


# def main():
#       print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")





# # This provided line is required at the end of
# # Python file to call the main() function.
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()


## Solution

def main():
    print("favorite_animal")



        # Ask the user for their favorite animal
    favorite_animal = input("What's your favorite animal? ")
    

    # Print the response with the user's favorite animal
    print("My favorite animal is also " + favorite_animal + "!")




# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
